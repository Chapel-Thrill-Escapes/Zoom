# Chapel Thrill Escapes - "Zoom" Team Building Activity

Welcome to the Chapel Thrill Escapes "Zoom" Team Building Activity, inspired by the book "Zoom" by Istvan Banyai. This activity is designed to enhance teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills in a fun and engaging way. Participants will work together to sequence images correctly, which, when zoomed out in the right order, reveal a larger picture and tell a unique story.

## Overview

"Zoom" is a picture book with no words, where each page shows a wider perspective. Similarly, in this activity, teams will receive parts of a larger image (inspired by "Zoom") and must figure out the correct sequence from the closest detail to the widest view. The challenge is to do this without seeing the images in advance, relying solely on descriptions given by team members.

## Objective

- **Enhance Communication Skills**: Teams must describe their images without showing them to others.
- **Promote Teamwork**: Success depends on working collaboratively to determine the sequence.
- **Develop Problem-Solving Skills**: Teams tackle the challenge of piecing together the puzzle from limited information.

## How It Works (Facilitator Instructions)

1. **Setup**: Each participant receives a unique image that is part of a larger sequence. These images are distributed randomly in the order in which particpants request their image.

2. **Description Phase**: Participants take turns describing their images to the rest of the team without revealing their actual picture. Descriptions should be detailed and clear.

3. **Sequencing Phase**: Based on the descriptions, the team discusses and decides on the probable sequence of the images from the closest detail to the widest perspective.

4. **Reveal and Reflect**: Once the sequence is agreed upon, images are revealed and compared against the correct sequence. The team then reflects on the experience, discussing what strategies worked well and what could be improved.

## Guidelines

- **No Showing Images**: Participants can describe their images in detail but cannot show their actual images to others.
- **Listen Carefully**: Pay close attention to each description, as details may provide clues for the sequencing.
- **Encourage Participation**: Everyone should have a chance to speak and contribute their thoughts.
- **Stay Positive**: Support each other's ideas and build a constructive discussion environment.

## Materials Needed

- A set of images from the "Zoom" sequence

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prepare the Images**: Split the "Zoom" sequence into individual images. Ensure there is one image per participant.
2. **Distribute Images**: Give one image to each participant randomly.
3. **Choose a Moderator**: The moderator will guide the activity, ensuring everyone follows the guidelines and keeping the discussion on track.

## Reflection Questions

After the activity, consider discussing the following questions as a team:

- What strategies did we use to determine the sequence, and how effective were they?
- How did we communicate and make decisions as a team?
- What challenges did we face, and how did we overcome them?
- How can we apply the skills learned from this activity to our daily work?

## Conclusion

The "Zoom" Team Building Activity is a great way to bring your team closer, challenging you to work together in new and creative ways. We hope you find this activity engaging and beneficial for enhancing your team's communication and collaboration skills. Enjoy the challenge!
